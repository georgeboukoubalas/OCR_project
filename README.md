Here is my personal PDF exractor useing python and some other staff that helped me to do that

To do that i have been use the OCR stracture to extract information from the PDF
Specifially i used the tesseract for OCR and pdf2image, poppler libs for editing PDF files
you can find very ease in internet how to download that staff
(personal preferanse search in youtube and github 
Warnning!!! its crucial, you need to have installed that libs to use that software otherwase error pop up

For informtion reasons the program grabs the PDF that you will provide into, no matter if it is an image of a only text file 
it recognaze any kind of letters, next it will create a txt file for putting all the text that have been readed over there

The main program that can you use is the Extractor.py and the ExtractorNo2.py

In more detail use the Extractor.py for more confortable usege 
Program will ask you first to write down the EXACT path to the PDF that you need to extract informtion from 
be cearfull that a small meastake like forgot a / can make the program crach
and then it will ask you for what you want for name of the txt file
It take a little to run but by that you will be ready 

in addition i have many other small programs that it will help me to build the main extractor you can check that also if you want

updated will be follow in feture for many new additions and dibuging
DO NO be hasitate to leave me a comment if you find any trable or for fixies it will be help me a lot
